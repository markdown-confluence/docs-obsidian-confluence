# Installing plugin using Obsidian42-BRAT

To install the `obsidian-confluence` plugin using [Obsidian42-BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat#Quick-Guide-for-using-BRAT), follow these steps:

## Adding a beta plugin

1. Install **BRAT** from the Community Plugins in Obsidian.
2. Get the link to the GitHub repository you want to test. The plugin developer can provide you with this link.
   For the `obsidian-confluence` plugin, use this link: https://github.com/markdown-confluence/markdown-confluence
3. Open the command palette and run the command `BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing` 
4. Using the link from step 2, copy that into the modal that opens up.
5. Click on **Add Plugin** -- wait a few seconds and BRAT will tell you what is going on.
6. After BRAT confirms the installation, in Settings go to the **Community plugins** tab.
7. Refresh the list of plugins.
8. Find the beta plugin you just installed (`obsidian-confluence`) and **Enable** it.

## Updating beta plugins

- Plugins can be updated using the command palette by running the command `Check for updates to all beta plugins and UPDATE`.
- Optionally, beta plugins can be configured to auto-update when starting Obsidian. This feature can be enabled in the **Obsidian42- BRAT** tab in settings.
